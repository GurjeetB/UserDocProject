# Create rollover buttons for a website

This section will showcase how to create rollover buttons which require 2 images of texts with exactly identical placement/size while changing in color.

Rollover buttons where mouse over causes the button image to change (i.e. change to a darker shade) provide clear visual feed back to the website's user about their potential selection.
